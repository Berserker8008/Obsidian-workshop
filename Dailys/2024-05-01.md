Today was a whirlwind of experiences. Despite the thunderstorm raging outside, I managed to concentrate and complete my studying for the upcoming Math exam. The sound of rain and thunder oddly helped me focus. The highlight of the day was definitely the unexpected swim with vikings. It was an unforgettable experience, swimming alongside those adventurous souls. However, I didn't make much progress on the workshop material, but the brainstorming session provided some promising ideas to explore further tomorrow.
