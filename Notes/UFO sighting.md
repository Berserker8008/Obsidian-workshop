Location: The mountain

## Description of Events

On the evening of February 30, 2023, while conducting routine astronomical observations in [[KFUPM tower]], I witnessed a series of unusual aerial phenomena that I believe to be consistent with the characteristics of [[Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs)]].
### Encounter Details

At approximately 9:00 PM local time, I observed a series of bright, pulsating lights moving erratically across the night sky. The lights appeared to be arranged in a triangular formation and exhibited rapid and unpredictable movements, unlike any conventional aircraft or [[celestial objects]].

As the objects traversed the sky, they emitted intermittent bursts of light and emitted low-frequency humming sounds, which intensified as they approached my location. Despite my attempts to capture photographic evidence, the objects moved too quickly and erratically for me to obtain clear images.
### Conclusion

Based on the observed characteristics and behavior of the objects, as well as the corroborating testimony of fellow witnesses, I am compelled to classify this event as a credible UFO sighting. While I cannot definitively ascertain the nature or origin of the objects, their anomalous behavior warrants further investigation by relevant authorities and scientific organizations.
