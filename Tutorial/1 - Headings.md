To create a heading, add number signs (`#`) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (`<h3>`), use three number signs (e.g., `### My Header`).

# Heading level 1

## Heading level 2 

### Heading level 3

#### Heading level 4
