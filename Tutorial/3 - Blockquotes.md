To create a blockquote, use the greater than sign (>) followed by the text you want to quote. 
## For example:

> This is a blockquote.

# Nesting Blockquotes

You can also nest blockquotes within each other for multiple levels of quoting. 

## For example:

> This is a level 1 blockquote.
>> This is a level 2 blockquote nested within the level 1 blockquote.
>>> This is a level 3 blockquote nested within the level 2 blockquote.

# Callouts

you can create callouts using the blockquote syntax (>) combined with an image tag (![tip]) to represent different types of callouts.

## For example

> [!tip] 
> Don't forget your jacket for building 54! It's chillier than a butcher's freezer in there. Don't let your teeth chatter during midterms!

> [!warning]
> You have no more absences left for Ramadan
