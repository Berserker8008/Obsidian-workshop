# Ordered Lists

To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers donâ€™t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.

## For example:

1. Perfect your procrastination techniques by organizing your sock drawer alphabetically.
2. Spend hours creating a detailed study schedule, complete with color-coded highlighters and motivational stickers.
3. Master the art of binge-watching obscure documentaries on topics unrelated to your midterm subjects.
4. Convince yourself that reorganizing your entire room is a necessary prerequisite for academic success.
5. Develop an elaborate strategy for avoiding eye contact with your textbook while pretending to study in public places.

# Unordered list

To create an unordered list, add dashes (`-`), asterisks (`*`), or plus signs (`+`) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.

## For example:

- Live 
- Laugh 
- Love
